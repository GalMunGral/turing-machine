# Universal Turing Machine

This is an attempt to make Turing's terse mathematical formalism more programmer-friendly. The code corresponds (almost exactly) to Turing's original formulation of the Universal Turing Machine in his 1936 paper ["On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem"](https://www.wolframscience.com/prizes/tm23/images/Turing.pdf) (See _S4. Abbreviated Tables_ and _S7. Detailed Description of the Universal Machine_).
